I work on artificial neural networks, Bayesian inference, machine learning and cosmological models of dark energy. I also participate in writing projects in Spanish, both creative writing (short stories and essays) and technical textbooks at the high school level.

On this website, contact information is on each page at the bottom of the page. There are also some posts in Spanish about programming or science.
