title: About this website
---

This page is an exercise of
freedom in technical and
scientific writing. The texts are intended to be didactic and consist of 
ideas that remain in the inkwell, concepts that have been 
interesting and tutorials that I would have liked to have found on the internet
and that I never found.

I have chosen to write, mainly, in Spanish because I am interested
in the Spanish-speaking public, particularly in Mexico and 
Latin America, 
where I think that is necessary to write more material promoting the 
scientific activity.

I'm sure I'll make several kinds of mistakes in my posts, therefore, I would be very grateful if someone 
points them out to me. 

Sincerely, 

Isidro Gomez Vargas.
