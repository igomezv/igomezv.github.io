-----------------------------------------------------------

### SimpleMC
Cosmological parameter estimation code developed by Dr. A. Slosar and Dr. JA Vazquez. From 2019 to 2023, I helped in maintaining the code, and incorporating nested sampling, convergence criteria for Metropolis-Hastings, post-processing options and other new features.

Collaborating with Dr. JA Vazquez.

### crann

CRANN (Cosmological Reconstructions with Artificial Neural Networks). Python notebooks with model-independent reconstructions for cosmological functions. We will soon clean up the code and shape it into a library for ease of use.
