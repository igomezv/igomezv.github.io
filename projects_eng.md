- Neuronal networks to decrease computation time
of a Bayesian inference process.

- Neural networks and auto-encoders to generate
synthetic cosmological data and perform reconstructions 
of functions.

- Collaboration in the cosmological parameter estimation code 
SimpleMC.

- Nested sampling algorithm.

- Data mining in medical data.

- Textbook writing. E.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.com.mx/Matem%C3%A1ticas-Ricardo-Garc%C3%ADa-Salcedo-Esquivel/dp/6075405224">Math 3</a>
